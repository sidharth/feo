4 years ago, I walked into the DTU campus for the very first time. Yesterday, I submitted my CS Major Project - a final step* towards graduating.

Over these last few years, I've had the privilege of meeting some incredibly talented people, who've broadened my perspective and helped me mature as a person. Looking back, I've put together some core values over this period that I try to keep close to heart:- 

- Always put in your best effort. It doesn't guarantee things will work out as you want them to, but you'll have no regrets.
- Compete with yourself, critique yourself and constantly improve yourself. Be better than you were yesterday. But don't ever compare yourself to other people. That's just a never-ending downward spiral. At the same time, do recognise what others are good at, and try to learn from that.
- Don't rush to judgements. Try to see things from multiple viewpoints, and understand their perspectives.
- Don't take things (including yourself) too seriously. Enjoy the little things. Life goes on.

It's been an exhilarating journey with some wonderful memories. Time for a break (and some Kotlin?) before the next act.

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
